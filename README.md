# Third Project

This project is a sophisticated Java web application developed using Spring Boot and built on a monolithic architecture. It encompasses both an admin panel and a public-facing website. The primary goal of the project is to create a comprehensive online platform for managing cinema operations, including ticket booking, seat selection, and user management. The project covers a wide range of technical tasks, from designing the database schema and developing business logic to deploying the application on a server via Tomcat.

## Project Idea

The website is designed for a cinema chain, allowing users to browse available movies, book tickets, select seats in specific halls, and access other cinema-related services. The admin panel provides functionality for managing movie listings, user statistics, etc.

## Key Features

- Admin and User Interfaces: The system features dedicated sections for admin and user interactions, ensuring a clear separation of roles and responsibilities within the application. The admin panel is built to allow full control over content and user management.
- Advanced CRUD Operations: The project supports robust Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for multiple entities, with highly optimized data retrieval and manipulation functions.
- Data Management and Filtering: Dynamic tables are used to present data efficiently, with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination mechanisms to handle large datasets seamlessly.
- High-Level Security: With Spring Security integrated, the application enforces comprehensive security protocols, including user authentication, authorization, and session management.
- Test Coverage and Reliability: All core business logic is extensively tested using jUnit and Mockito, ensuring the reliability and stability of the system under various conditions.
- CI/CD Integration: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to automate testing and deployment processes, reducing manual effort and ensuring a streamlined development workflow.
- Scalability and Logging: The project is designed to scale efficiently, with Log4j2 integrated for comprehensive service logging, providing critical insights into application performance and issues.

## Additional Resources

- Server Deployment: The application is deployed on a server using Tomcat, with connection details available in the Teamwork notebook.
- CI/CD Integration: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines are set up to streamline the development process and automate the deployment of new features.
- UML Diagrams: The project includes comprehensive ERD diagrams for the entire database schema and UML diagrams for the object-oriented programming (OOP) classes and their relationships.
- Project Timeline: A summary table detailing the planned versus actual time spent on the project.

## Technology Stack

- Version Control: Using GitHub throughout the development of the entire project.
